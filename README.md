# Dreambooth-StableDiffusion
Finetuning a stable diffusion model and inferencing with it for fun
- Intended for users to finetune and train the model with their own images for custom text2img generation.
- Training dataset can be as small as 5 images
- Currently hosted on Colab with ipywidgets to simplify interfacing with it.
